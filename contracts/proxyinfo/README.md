# Telos Proxy Info
This is an on-chain Telos contract that allows Telos proxy accounts to register additional information about themselves, such as name and website. This information is published on the Telos blockchain, is accessible via the [Sqrl Wallet](https://github.com/Telos-Foundation/Sqrl) and freely available to be republished. An example website that uses this information on the EOS chain is the [Aloha EOS Proxy Research Portal](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy).

The contract should be published on the `regproxyinfo` account on the Telos mainnet.

### Set

The set action inserts or updates information about your account. The paramaters are:
- **proxy** (required): Your Telos account name.
- **name** (required, 64 char max): The full name of your proxy.
- **slogan** (optional, 64 char max): A short description of your proxy intended to be shown in listings.
